# Coursework for Social Information Networks Analysis and Engineering @ HKUST

This repository contains some of the course work for the course Social Information Networks Analysis and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

## List of work

- `q1-1.py`
  - Implements the Girvan-Newman algorithm and outputs the resultant hierarchical decomposition of the network.
  - Implements the calculation of modularity, and outputs the corresponding cluster structure.
- `q1-2.py`
  - Examines the effect of rewiring probability on mean clustering coefficient and mean node-node distance in a Watts-Strogatz small-world model.
- `q2-1.ipynb`
  - Generate graphs with nodes that fulfil certain centrality measures
